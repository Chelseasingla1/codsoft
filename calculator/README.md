# Simple Calculator

## Overview

This project is a basic calculator developed in C++ as part of my internship task at CodSoft. The calculator can perform four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user is prompted to input two numbers and select an operation, after which the result is displayed.

## Features

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- Basic understanding of C++ programming

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-calculator.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd simple-calculator
    ```

### Building and Running

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
    ```sh
    g++ -o calculator calculator.cpp
    ```
2. Run the compiled program:
    ```sh
    ./calculator
    ```

## How to Use

1. Run the calculator program.
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter the desired operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
4. Enter the second number.
5. The program will display the result of the calculation.
6. If an unrecognized operation is entered, the program will display "Not a recognized operation".
